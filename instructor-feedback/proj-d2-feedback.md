## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 

This looks great! Keep going! 

- We have no experience with Django (or web development) and were wondering if
it was realistic for us to create an interactive map and scale our learning curve in
the next two weeks.  Are there alternative tools that would be suitable for our
task (e.g. Python Dash)?

Yes, if you have little experience with Django and haven't started that component at this point then I would recommend that you go an easier package such as Python Dash. 

- Our current distribution of work is such that 1-2 team members will focus on the
statistical component of our work (i.e., index-building) and 1-2 members will
focus on building our interactive map.  All four of us will be involved in
programming some features of this map, but some team members will do less
computer programming and more data analysis.  Does this raise any concerns?


No, I don't think that's a problem. Each member has their strengths so it's fine to assign jobs based on traits that will get the project completed. 

- Is it acceptable to use R for data wrangling, or would you encourage us to use
Python (pandas) instead?

Yes, you can use R for data wrangling. 

- The most recent year for which data are consistently available is 2017.  Does this
raise any concerns?

No, I think that's reasonable. It's a 5 year timeline so that's fine.
