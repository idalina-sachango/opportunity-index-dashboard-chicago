# proj-tools4schools
Final Project for CAPP122

# Team
Akila Forde, Dharini Ramaswamy, Idalina Sachango, Nivedita Vatsa

# Description
Our team is interested in exploring inequity in the Chicago school system. Our goal is to develop an index at the school-level that measures a student’s level of opportunity.  We will then compare our constructed index with college enrollment rates to validate our results.  It will consider factors such as school environment, economic hardship, crime, housing security, access to nutrition, access to the internet, and school budget allocation.  We hope that education institutions can utilize our index and analysis to effectively allocate resources and support students’ learning needs. This index is inspired by the Child Opportunity Index 2.0 project.  We intend to follow a similar methodology, but this time, the data (and corresponding weights) will be Chicago-specific.
