# Description
In this project, our team explored factors that affect educational inequity in the Chicago public school system. We accomplished this by developing an index that measures a studentâ€™s level of opportunity for each school. In calculating our opportunity index, we weighted factors such as internet access, poverty rate, unemployment rate, air pollution, median household earnings and school budget allocation. Our visualizations map the calculated opportunity index, school budget allocation and poverty rate at the census tract level and include distinctions for school size. Additionally, we compared our constructed index with college enrollment rates to validate our results. Our results indicate that the opportunity index is positively correlated with college enrollment rates, meaning that a studentâ€™s level of opportunity impacts the likelihood that they will enroll in a four-year college. We hope that education institutions can utilize our index and analysis to effectively allocate resources and support studentsâ€™ learning needs. This index is inspired by the Child Opportunity Index 2.0 project. We followed a similar methodology and utilized Chicago-specific data and weights.
